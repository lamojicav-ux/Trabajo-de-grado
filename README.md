# RNA-seq Analysis – Undergraduate Thesis

This repository documents the RNA-seq analysis performed for my undergraduate biology thesis.

## Study design
- Organism: Homo sapiens
- Treatments: 3 experimental conditions
- Replicates: 3 biological replicates per treatment
- Sequencing type: RNA-seq

## Overview of the analysis
The analysis included:
- Quality control and trimming (performed externally)
- Alignment using Bowtie
- Post-processing with Samtools
- Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 in R

⚠️ Some steps of the original workflow were executed on institutional servers and are partially reconstructed here for documentation purposes.

## Tools used
- FastQC
- Trimmomatic 
- Bowtie
- Samtools
- R / DESeq2
- Bash

## Repository structure
This repository will contain:
- `scripts/`: analysis scripts
- `results/`: plots and result tables
- `report/`: thesis-related documentation

## Status
This repository is under active reconstruction for portfolio and documentation purposes.
